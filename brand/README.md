# crossecute — brand mark

The mark is a lockup: a **check** joined to **spokes fanning out to four nodes**,
above the wordmark.

- **Check:** the verification step. Nothing moves until what you signed is proven
  to be what was built.
- **Spokes → nodes:** one origin carrying control outward to every destination
  chain. Uniform and interchangeable — *any* chain.

## Files

| File | Use |
|------|-----|
| `crossecute-icon-white.png` | Dark mark on a white tile — for light backgrounds |
| `crossecute-icon-black.png` | Light mark on a black tile — for dark backgrounds |
| `crossecute-avatar-512.png` | Square 512×512 avatar — mark only, no wordmark |

Both are raster PNGs with rounded corners and transparent corner pixels, so they
sit cleanly on any background. Pick the variant matching the surface behind it,
or serve both via `<picture>` and `prefers-color-scheme` (see `profile/README.md`).

## Palette

The mark is monochrome.

| Token | Hex | Role |
|-------|-----|------|
| Ink | `#000000` | Mark on light surfaces; tile on the black variant |
| Paper | `#FFFFFF` | Mark on dark surfaces; tile on the white variant |

## Setting the GitHub org avatar

GitHub avatars are UI-only, must be raster, and are cropped to a square:

1. Go to **https://github.com/organizations/crossecute/settings/profile**
2. Under **Profile picture**, click **Upload a picture…**
3. Choose `crossecute-avatar-512.png`, position, and save.

Use the avatar file, not the lockups — the lockups are non-square and their
wordmark becomes unreadable once GitHub crops and scales them down. The avatar
is the mark alone at 78% coverage, which stays clear at small sizes and survives
the circular crop GitHub applies in comment threads and member lists.
